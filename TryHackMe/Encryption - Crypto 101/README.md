# Task 1

### This room will cover:

-   Why cryptography matters for security and CTFs
-   The two main classes of cryptography and their uses
-   RSA, and some of the uses of RSA
-   2 methods of Key Exchange
-   Notes about the future of encryption with the rise of Quantum Computing

Note: This room expects some familiarity with tools, and some research into how to use them yourself!

# Task 2(Key terms)

**Ciphertext** - The result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data

**Cipher** - A method of encrypting or decrypting data. Modern ciphers are cryptographic, but there are many non cryptographic ciphers like Caesar.

**Plaintext** - Data before encryption, often text but not always. Could be a photograph or other file

**Encryption** - Transforming data into ciphertext, using a cipher.

**Encoding** - NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.

**Key** - Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.

**Passphrase** - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.

**Asymmetric encryption** - Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.

**Symmetric encryption** - Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt

**Brute force** - Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key

**Cryptanalysis** - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths

**Alice and Bob** - Used to represent 2 people who generally want to communicate. They’re named Alice and Bob because this gives them the initials A and B. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob) for more information, as these extend through the alphabet to represent many different people involved in communication.

## Questions

**I agree not to complain too much about how theory heavy this room is.**

> **_Answer_**: No answer needed

**Are SSH keys protected with a passphrase or a password?**

> **_Answer_**: passphrase
