Looking through the source code we see that the `vuln` function takes a string argument `input` and copies it into a buffer called `buf2` with a size of 16 bytes using the `strcpy` function. Since `buf2` has a fixed size of 16 bytes, if `input` is longer than 16 bytes, a buffer overflow will occur and could potentially overwrite other parts of the memory, including the return address, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

```C
void vuln(char *input){
char buf2[16]; 
strcpy(buf2, input); 
}
```

Connecting to the program using netcat, I try to overflow the input value by adding string longer than 16 bytes:

>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

And there is the flag:

>flag: picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef7314c6}
