The "robots.txt" file is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and other automated agents accessing the site. It is a text file that is placed in the root directory of a website and specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by automated agents like search engine bots.

The format of a "robots.txt" file is relatively simple. It typically consists of a set of user-agent directives that specify which crawlers are affected by each rule, followed by one or more "disallow" directives that indicate which parts of the site should not be crawled. For example, the following "robots.txt" file would prevent all crawlers from accessing the /admin directory of a website:

```
User-agent: * 
Disallow: /admin/
```
