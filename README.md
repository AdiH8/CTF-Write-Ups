# CTF Write-ups
This repository contains a collection of write-ups for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. The write-ups are meant to serve as a reference for individuals interested in learning about CTFs and their various types of challenges.

## Structure
Each challenge's write-up is contained in its own directory. The directory name should reflect the name of the challenge. Within each directory, there should be a markdown file containing the write-up, as well as any necessary files (e.g., binaries, scripts, etc.) needed to solve the challenge.
